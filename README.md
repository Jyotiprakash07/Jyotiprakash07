## 🎼 Signature Solo: Code That Sings

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x = np.linspace(0, 2*np.pi, 100)
y = np.sin(x) + 0.5 * np.sin(3*x)
plt.plot(x, y, color='purple', linewidth=2)
plt.title("🎶 Harmonic Overture — Wave Superposition")
plt.xlabel("Phase")
plt.ylabel("Amplitude")
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()


> 🎶 _This plot isn’t just data — it’s my solo at center stage._
